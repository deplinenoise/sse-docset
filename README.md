Create Dash docset from Intel Intrinsic Guide data

This is a quick hack to convert the data from Intel Intrinsics Guide
(https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html) to a Dash
docset. A prebuilt docset is available in Releases.

You'll need the XML file found at:
https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/public/us/en/include/intrinsics-guide/data-latest.xml
